# Problem Statement:
While some enjoy listening and creating music by themselves, music can also be a social experience with events such as concerts and jams. While some musicians may have talent/experience in producing a track from start to finish, others may specialize in some specific aspects. Collaborating with others will allow a musician to experiment with different sounds and techniques they are not familiar with while also covering for their inexperience in specific aspects of music production. However, to find a musical collaborator, you would have to make a posting online on Facebook/Craigslist with your contact information and wait for someone to contact you, or you would have to have a network of contacts that may know people who can help you. We aim to improve the social experience for creating music by allowing musicians to find collaborators and arrange meetups in a simple and easy fashion.

# Problem Scenario:
Jack is a producer looking for a female vocalist on his electronic track. In order to find someone who fits the criteria, he decides to use Band-Aid (the mobile application) to search for someone who can come in to his studio and record vocals. While looking at profiles on the application, Jack finds Elaine's profile and messages her to see if she is interested. Elaine replies a couple of days later indicating interest. The two agree to collaborate and do so successfully, resulting in Jack being able to achieve his vision for the track.

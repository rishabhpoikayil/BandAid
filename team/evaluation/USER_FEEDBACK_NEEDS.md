# User Feedback Needs

## 1. User Experience Assessment
We seek user insights on the overall usability, navigation, and key aspects that contribute to or impede the app experience. Observations regarding challenges or areas of difficulty and suggestions for improvement are valuable to enhance the overall user experience.

## 2. Design Preference for Profile Display
Considering the importance of user profiles in our app, we are interested in preferences for the display format. We would like feedback on whether users prefer a card-based layout or a list-based layout for viewing profiles, focusing on ease of use and visual appeal.

## 3. A/B UI Design Choice Test: Scrolling vs. Swiping
**Note:** This idea has already been executed in our recent evaluation process. We conducted an A/B UI design choice test to determine user preferences for the home page interactionâ€”scrolling vs. swiping. The results favored scrolling (15 votes) over swiping (10 votes), guiding our decision to implement a scrolling home page. We may consider seeking additional feedback on the implemented choice to gauge user satisfaction and identify any potential improvements.

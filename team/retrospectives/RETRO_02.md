* Led By: Rishabh Poikayil
* Present: Leon Feng, Kirill Aristarkhov, Rishabh Poikayil, Andy Gonzalez
* Absent: Aviv Samet

## Action Item

* **Goal:** Clarify team objectives to prevent Kanban board overlap within the same domain.
* **Change:** Strengthening our UI development process by implementing a robust code review system to enhance collaboration and mitigate merge issues.
* **Measurement:** Track the reduction in merge conflicts and the time taken to resolve them before and after the implementation of the code review process. Additionally, assess the clarity of objectives by monitoring the frequency of Kanban board overlap within the same domain.

## Optional

* *Record:* The team collectively decided to shift focus towards refining the UI design and its subsequent implementation in the upcoming weeks.

## Retro Assessment

* **Outline/Process Used:** Utilized the deliverable format outlined in the Section03 description.
* **Assessment:** The retro discussion was productive, leading to a consensus on prioritizing UI fine-tuning in the coming weeks.
* **Advice:** Ensure inclusive participation in discussions with the aid of online communication tools like Slack and Zoom for remote team members.

## Retro Outcome

* *Effect of Change:* Strengthening our code review process notably improved our team's capacity to refine UI design. This positive shift resulted in promptly completing profile cards, a key UI component, within a single sprint post-retro.

* *Measurement Result:* The team observed a noticeable decrease in merge conflicts, with a faster resolution time after implementing the code review process. Additionally, the frequency of Kanban board overlap within the same domain reduced, indicating improved clarity in team objectives.

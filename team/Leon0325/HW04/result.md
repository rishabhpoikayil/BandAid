## Before:
Here are some of the reuseable components and assets I designed, implemented, and discovered, which are used across our application. In addition, I'm the main backend developer on the team and I built many backend APIs as well as database table designs which in a way dictates how my other teammates later on build our UI workflow to consume these APIs. I also frequently collaborate with my other teammates on high level UI workflow and how they can connect their UIs to our backend APIs.

### Here are some of the images of our real time chat room feature.

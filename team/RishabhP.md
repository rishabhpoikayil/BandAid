My name is Rishabh Poikayil and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in computer science at UC Santa Barbara. I am currently taking CMPSC 184 as an upper-division elective in Fall 2023 and this is my first time working in the field of mobile application development. My team will be using Flutter to develop our application and I am excited to learn about this new technology in the process!

- **`team/rishabhpoikayil/HW04/`:**
  - **Visual Summaries:**
    - `unit_test_results.png`: Screenshot of successful unit test results for backend functionality.
    - `component_test_results.png`: Screenshot of the component test results for the gradient button.
    - `ab_ui_test_sketch.png`: Sketch used for the A/B UI design choice test.
  - `results.md`: Contains summaries of visual outcomes from test results and the A/B UI design choice sketch.

### Instructions:
1. Explore `dev/bandaid/test/` for the individual test files and their purposes.
2. Analyze the content in `team/rishabhpoikayil/HW04/` for insights into the A/B UI design choice test, including confirmation images for the unit and component tests.
3. Check `team/rishabhpoikayil/HW04/` for summaries on the outcomes, detailed in `results.md`.

HW4 Decisions:

Rishabh - testing - Create unit and integration tests for our UI. Aviv checks.

Aviv - implementation - Create means of uploading music and images (and keep them in the cloud). Kirill checks.

Andy - implementation - Create the real-time (or somewhat realotime) chat between users. Socket IO integration. Leon checks.

Leon - design - Design the user flow and overall look for the chatting functionality. Andy checks.

Kirill - documentation - Begin working on the app documentation with the focus on the tech stack (back end) visualization. Rishabh checks.
